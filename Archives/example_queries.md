### Question 1: What are the freezers used for?
**Answer:** The freezers are used for storing biological samples. [16, 1, 23]

### Question 2: Where are the samples stored?
**Answer:** According to the context, the samples are stored in liquid nitrogen freezers at -196°C, and also in dry ice, which is used as a refrigerant for shipping. [16, 11, 23, 15]

### Question 3: Generally, what are the samples about?
**Answer:**
The samples appear to be related to various topics, including:

1. **Biomedical research and laboratory practices** (e.g., specimen collection, storage, and processing).
2. **Business and finance** (e.g., revenue, expenses, and profitability).
3. **Telecommunications and technology** (e.g., wireless and broadband services).
4. **Occupational safety and health regulations** (e.g., OSHA guidelines).

It's challenging to pinpoint a single, overarching theme, as the samples seem to cover diverse subjects. [16, 24, 19, 23]

### Question 4: What are some uses of samples in biomedical research and laboratory practices?
**Answer:**
In biomedical research and laboratory practices, samples are used for various purposes, including:

1. **Disease diagnosis and monitoring**: Biological samples, such as blood, tissue, or urine, are used to diagnose and monitor diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, and genetic disorders.
2. **Research and development**: Samples are used to develop new treatments, vaccines, and diagnostic tools, and to understand the underlying biology of diseases.
3. **Quality control and assurance**: Samples are used to ensure the quality of laboratory tests, reagents, and equipment.
4. **Toxicology and pharmacology studies**: Samples are used to study the effects of drugs, chemicals, and other substances on living organisms.
5. **Forensic analysis**: Biological samples, such as DNA, are used in forensic science to aid in the investigation of crimes.
6. **Population-based studies**: Samples are used to study the health and disease patterns of populations, and to identify risk factors and trends.
7. **Biobanking**: Samples are stored in biobanks for future research, enabling the study of diseases and the development of new treatments over time.

These are just a few examples of the many uses of samples in biomedical research and laboratory practices. [16, 17, 20, 23, 24]

### Question 5: What are the parameters under which the samples are stored?
**Answer:** Cryoprotectants that are less toxic have been developed to allow for preservation of RNA and DNA in blood and other specimens. Whole blood may also be cryopreserved in large-scale epidemiological studies. Saliva or blood collected on treated paper cards is available for laboratory applications. Enough DNA can be obtained from a 2mm punch of a paper card for about 500 reactions. [9, 3, 12]

### Question 6: List down some types of specimens.
**Answer:** Based on the provided context, some types of specimens mentioned are:

- Blood
- Urine
- Saliva

Please note that these are the only types of specimens explicitly mentioned in the provided context. There may be other types of specimens not mentioned here. [3]

### Question 7: List down all the types and definitions of specimens you know.
**Answer:** Here are some types and definitions of specimens:

1. **Biological specimen**: A sample of tissue, blood, or other bodily fluid taken from a living organism for diagnostic, therapeutic, or research purposes.
2. **Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen**: A tissue sample that has been preserved in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax to create a solid block that can be sectioned and stained for histological examination.
3. **Frozen specimen**: A tissue or cell sample that has been frozen to preserve its molecular structure and function, often used for DNA, RNA, or protein analysis.
4. **Fresh specimen**: A tissue or cell sample that has not been fixed or preserved, often used for immediate analysis or processing.
5. **Cryopreserved specimen**: A tissue or cell sample that has been frozen at very low temperatures (typically -196°C) to preserve its molecular structure and function, often used for long-term storage.
6. **Chemically fixed specimen**: A tissue or cell sample that has been treated with a chemical fixative to preserve its structure and prevent degradation, often used for histological examination.
7. **Paraffin-embedded specimen**: A tissue sample that has been embedded in paraffin wax to create a solid block that can be sectioned and stained for histological examination.
8. **Whole blood specimen**: A sample of whole blood collected from a patient or donor for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
9. **Serum specimen**: A sample of blood serum (the liquid portion of blood) collected from a patient or donor for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
10. **Urine specimen**: A sample of urine collected from a patient or donor for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
11. **Tissue microarray (TMA) specimen**: A collection of tissue samples arranged in a grid pattern on a single slide, often used for high-throughput analysis of multiple tissue samples.
12. **Cell block specimen**: A sample of cells that have been aggregated and embedded in a paraffin block, often used for histological examination.
13. **Cytology specimen**: A sample of cells collected from a patient or donor for diagnostic purposes, often used for cytological examination.
14. **Histology specimen**: A tissue sample that has been processed and stained for histological examination.
15. **Molecular specimen**: A sample of tissue, blood, or other bodily fluid collected for molecular analysis, such as DNA, RNA, or protein analysis.

These are just a few examples of the types of specimens. [24, 17, 26, 19]

### Question 8: What are some ways to collect urine?
**Answer:** Here are some ways to collect urine:

1. **Clean Catch Midstream Urine Collection**: This is the most common method. The patient cleans their genital area, starts urinating, and then collects a sample in a sterile container.
2. **Catheterization**: A healthcare professional inserts a catheter into the bladder to collect a urine sample. This method is often used for patients who cannot urinate on their own or have a urinary tract infection.
3. **Urine Bag Collection**: A sterile urine collection bag is attached to the genital area to collect urine. This method is often used for infants or young children.
4. **Suprapubic Aspiration**: A healthcare professional uses a needle to collect a urine sample directly from the bladder. This method is often used for patients with urinary retention or bladder dysfunction.
5. **Urinary Catheter with a Collection Bag**: A urinary catheter is inserted into the bladder, and a collection bag is attached to collect urine. This method is often used for patients who require continuous urine drainage.

It's essential to follow proper techniques and guidelines when collecting urine to ensure the sample is sterile and accurate for laboratory testing. [18, 19, 13]
