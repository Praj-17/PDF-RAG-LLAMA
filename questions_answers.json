Fractionation results in different components such as mononuclear leukocytes.\n\n2. **Tissue**:\n   - Specific details about the types of tissues are not provided in the given context, but generally, tissue specimens can include biopsies or other cellular samples from various organs.\n\n3. **Urine**:\n   - Urine samples are collected for various analyses, including molecular studies.\n\n4. **Saliva**:\n   - Saliva can be collected non-invasively and used for various types of analyses, including DNA extraction.\n\nThese specimen types are chosen for their convenience, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for large population-based studies.",

This method allows for comparisons of excretion patterns over time.\n\n2. **Urine Collection on Ice or Refrigerated**: To preserve specimen stability, urine collections should be maintained on ice or refrigerated during the entire collection period.\n\nThese methods are used in various studies to compare urine analyte levels with their concentrations in blood and other specimens.",
